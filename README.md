from colorama import Fore, Back, Style

def generate_lucky_number(min_val=1, max_val=100):
    """Generate a random number within specified range"""
    return random.randint(min_val, max_val)

def validate_input(user_input, min_val, max_val):
    """Validate user input and provide feedback"""
    try:
        guess = int(user_input)
        if min_val <= guess <= max_val:
            return guess, True
        else:

            user_input = input(prompt)
            if user_input.lower() in ['quit', 'exit']:
                return None
            
            value = input_type(user_input)
            if validator and not validator(value):
                raise ValueError("Invalid input")
            
            return value
